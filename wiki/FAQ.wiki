#summary Greasefire FAQ

*How does Greasefire impact my privacy?  Do you track what sites I visit?*

Greasefire does *not* record or send any data to a server while you browse the web.  The process that matches scripts to the sites you visit is done by querying a local index of all the scripts from userscripts.org (see the files include.dat, exclude.dat, and scripts.db in the extension directory).  Updated versions of these index files are downloaded periodically to ensure you see the latest scripts available.

*Does Greasefire search all scripts on userscripts.org?*

No -- The goal of Greasefire is to match scripts to specific web sites, therefore scripts that are designed to work on all sites are explicitly excluded from the index.  I maintain a list of @include lines that I feel are too general, and these scripts are filtered out when the indexes are generated.  See the `badIncludesList` in [http://code.google.com/p/greasefire/source/browse/java/greasefire-scraper/src/com/skrul/greasefire/Generate.java Generate.java].

*How are the scripts ranked?*



*Why is the extension download so big?  It is over 2MB!*
